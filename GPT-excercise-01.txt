Sure, I can recommend a project for you to practice your frontend development skills. Here's a project idea that you can work on:

Project Idea: To-Do List Application

Create a web-based to-do list application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The application should allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.
Use local storage to save the tasks so that they persist even if the user closes the browser.
Use webpack to initialize the project.
Here's how you can set up the project using webpack:

Install Node.js and npm on your computer, if you haven't already.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
Run the following commands to create a new npm project and install webpack:
csharp
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev
Create the following directory structure in your project folder:
markdown
Copy code
- src/
  - index.js
  - index.html
  - styles/
    - main.css
- dist/
  - index.html
  - main.js
Open webpack.config.js in the root directory of your project and add the following code:
javascript
Copy code
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  mode: 'development',
  devtool: 'inline-source-map',
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
  },
};
This configuration tells webpack to take the index.js file in the src/ folder as the entry point of the application, bundle it with all its dependencies, and output the result in the dist/ folder as main.js. The mode option is set to 'development' to enable webpack's development mode, and the devtool option is set to 'inline-source-map' to generate source maps for debugging purposes. Finally, the devServer option tells webpack-dev-server to serve the files from the dist/ folder.

Open src/index.html and add the following code:
html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>To-Do List App</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles/main.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1>To-Do List</h1>
  <form>
    <input type="text" placeholder="Add a task">
    <button>Add</button>
  </form>
  <ul>
    <!-- Tasks will be dynamically added here -->
  </ul>
  <script src="./main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
This code sets up the basic structure of the application, including a form for adding tasks and an empty <ul> element where tasks will be displayed.

Open src/index.js and add the following code:
javascript
Copy code
const taskForm = document.querySelector('form');
const taskInput = document.querySelector('input');
const taskList = document.querySelector('ul');

let tasks = [];

function renderTasks() {
  taskList.innerHTML = '';
  for (let i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
    const task = tasks[i];
    const li = document.createElement('li');
    li.textContent = task;
    const checkbox = document.createElement('input');
    checkbox.type = 'checkbox';
    checkbox.checked = false;
    checkbox.addEventListener('change', () => {
      task.completed = !task.completed;
      renderTasks();
    });
    const deleteButton =
